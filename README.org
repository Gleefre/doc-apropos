=doc-apropos= provides similar functionality to ~apropos~, but allows to search documentation of symbols.

* Quickstart
  Clone repository to your local-projects directory. Then load ~:doc-apropos~ system.
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload :doc-apropos)  ; with quicklisp
  (asdf:load-system :doc-apropos)  ; with asdf
  #+END_SRC
  It will scan all available symbols, so it might take some time.

  To search through documentation simply use ~doc-apropos~ function:
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  CL-USER> (doc-apropos:doc-apropos "prints the message")
  COMMON-LISP:Y-OR-N-P
  Y-OR-N-P prints the message, if any, and reads characters from
     *QUERY-IO* until the user enters y or Y as an affirmative, or either
     n or N as a negative answer. It asks again if you enter any other
     characters.
  ; => 1
  #+END_SRC

  By default it searchs for functions.
  To search through other type of documentation pass additional parameter:
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  CL-USER> (doc-apropos:doc-apropos "characters" 'structure)
  COMMON-LISP:READTABLE
  A READTABLE is a data structure that maps characters into syntax
  types for the Common Lisp expression reader.
  ; => 1
  #+END_SRC

  If you want to reregister the available symbols, you can use ~initialize-index~ function:
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  CL-USER> (doc-apropos:initialize-index)
  ; => 10815
  ; => 2571
  #+END_SRC
  It returns two values: number of symbols scanned and number of descriptions found (and added).
